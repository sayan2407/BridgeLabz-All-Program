1)Method Overloading is _________ Polymorphism

ans:   compile time 

2)Method Overriding is _________ Polymorphism

ans:  Run time 

3)Explain Static Polymorphism

ans:
 (i)Static polymorphism happens in the same class.
 (ii)Object assignment is not required for static polymorphism.
 (iii)Static Polymorphism decides which method to execute during compile time.
 (iv)Method Overloading is an example of static polymorphism, 
     and it is requred to happens static polymorphism.  

4)Explain Dynamic Polymorphism

ans:
 Dynamic polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overridden method 
 is resolved at runtime, thats why it is called runtime polymorphism. 

5)Polymorphism makes it possible to use same Entity in different forms 
  â€“ Explain why???? 
ans:

Polymorphism can take two forms: method overloading and method overriding.
Method overriding occurs when the child class overrides a 
method of its parent.
So,Polymorphism allows you to implement multiple methods within 
the different class that use the same name but a different 
set of parameters.
