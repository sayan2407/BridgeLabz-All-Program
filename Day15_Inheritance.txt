1)A class (child class) can extend another class (parent class) by 
inheriting its features using ___________ *

ans:

Inheritance by extend keyword.

2)Explain -- how Inheritance Implements the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) 
  programming principle.
ans :
  
Don't repeat yourself (DRY, or sometimes do not repeat yourself) is a
principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition 
of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or 
using data normalization to avoid redundancy.So,Using Inheritance child
class can extend parent class i.e inheriting its all features.So, Its
maintain DRY principle.

3) Explain how Inheritance Improves code reusability
ans:

Inheritance is a process of defining a new class based on an 
existing class by extending its common data members and methods. 
Inheritance allows us to reuse of code, it improves reusability in our
java application.

4)Explain why Strong Dependency between Child and Parent Class

ans:
A dependency is a relationship between two or more objects in which 
an object depends on the other object or objects for its 
implementation. If one of these objects change, 
the other object(s) can be impacted.So,In Inheritance also child class
and parent class has very strong relationship like dependency.If
parent class will modify then its impact on child class also.So They have 
very strong Dependency.

5)Is Multi-level Inheritance allowed in Java 
ans :
       yes

6)Explain Why Multi-type Inheritance not allowed in Java
ans:

Consider a case where class B extends class A and Class C and 
both class A and C have the same method display().
Now java compiler cannot decide, which display method 
it should inherit. To prevent such situation,
 multiple inheritances is not allowed in java.
